# Ruby Koans

An exploration of the Ruby programming language using test driven development.

## Getting started

To clone this repo:
* git@github.com:AJ8GH/ruby-koans.git
* https://github.com/AJ8GH/ruby-koans.git

## Usage

The exercises are completed but running the tests and observing the error messages.
Tweak the code for each test case to make it pass.
This approach builds understanding of testing, TDD and edge cases within Ruby

## Running tests

Running each file separately will run only the tests for the exercises in that specific section.
Running the `path_enlightenment.rb` runs all tests and shows overall progress.
